        ## Venue

        The "Ciudad Cultural Konex" complex is one of the top Buenos Aires venues -- having held art exhibitions, theater & entertainment, cultural enrichment events, and business conventions.

        The complex is **massive**: 2655m<sup>2</sup> with a generous front yard, several large gathering areas, and two spacious auditoriums -- which explains the wide variety of events that have been held at _CCK_ in the past.

        When combined with its amplitude and unique layout, its design has attracted _several_ **development conventions** in the past, making it a well-regarded venue that's recognized by many locals for its convenience, conception, and generous dimensions.

        ## Key Success Indicators

        We are a small team of experienced event organizers who have already delivered in the past. *Together*, we've organized countless local [NodeSchool][nodeschool], [NodeBots][nodebots], and [BeerJS][beerjs] events, as well as other [regular][banode] meetups.

        Nicolás is a [frequent conference speaker][bevacqua-speaking], a published author, a profilic open-source contributor, and passionate about community-building in Buenos Aires -- where he organizes _BeerJS_ and co-organizes _NodeSchool_ events. He knows the conference scene inside out and understands what turns an event into an unforgettable experience.

        Alejandro initially brought _NodeSchool_ to Buenos Aires, **jumpstarting the local Node.js community**. He is passionate about education, electronics, open-source, and community-driven events. These days, he also helps organize _NodeBots_ and a local Node.js meetup. He knows how to foster an inclusive environment where attendees can share their knowledge, learn, feel safe and make friends.

        Leandro has over 15 years experience in development, **managing teams** ranging from infrastructure to interface design. He's an IoT enthusiast and an early Node.js adopter. Leandro produced important cultural events in the City of Buenos Aires, having worked in public broadcasting for several years. He brings **a wealth of event--organizing experience** to the table.

        Lars is a JavaScript hacker and has been **using Node.js in production for several years** in his role as the technical lead of a Buenos Aires---based startup. Growing the local Node.js community is what drives him: he helps organize _NodeSchool_ and a local Node.js meetup. He is **passionate about offering community-building opportunities**, as well as spreading technical knowledge about Node.js.

      :megamark
        As NodeConf Argentina is taking place in a developing nation, we must pay close attention to our ticket fees _(from $100 to $180 vs. $500+ abroad)_ and keep them accessible to local attendees.

        Our cost structure -- however -- is similar to that of US or Europe-based conferences. Our sponsors are our most important partners and we are willing to go the extra mile to accommodate your needs and wants.

        Whether you are looking for brand exposure, new hires, to launch a product, or you have something a bit more creative in mind, we have a sponsorship opportunity for you.
